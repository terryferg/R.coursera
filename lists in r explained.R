### understanding list and [] vs [[]]

##  A list is a generic vector containing other objects.

##  For example, the following variable x is a list containing copies of three vectors n, s, b, and a numeric value 3.

n = c(2, 3, 5) 
s = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee") 
b = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) 
x = list(n, s, b, 3)   # x contains copies of n, s, b

##  List Slicing
##  We retrieve a list slice with the single square bracket "[]" operator. The 
##  following is a slice containing the second member of x, which is a copy
##  of s.

x[2] 
#  [[1]] 
#  [1] "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"

##  With an index vector, we can retrieve a slice with multiple members. Here
##  a slice containing the second and fourth members of x.
 x[c(2, 4)] 
##  [[1]] 
##  [1] "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee" 

#  [[2]] 
#  [1] 3

##  Member Reference
##  In order to reference a list member directly, we have to use the double square 
##  bracket "[[]]" operator. The following object x[[2]] is the second member of x.
##  In other words, x[[2]] is a copy of s, but is not a slice containing s or its copy.

 x[[2]] 
# [1] "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"
##  We can modify its content directly.

x[[2]][1] = "ta" 
x[[2]] 
# [1] "ta" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee" 

s 
# [1] "aa" "bb" "cc" "dd" "ee"   # s is unaffected
x
